# USACO Bronze - Juni #

## What ##

C++ and Python solutions to [USACO challenges](https://train.usaco.org/) found in [Juni Learning](https://junilearning.com/)'s USACO Bronze course.  
Numbering is according to Juni's order, but naming is USACO-based.

## Why ##

I need to teach kids how to do these projects, so I had better do them myself!  
Now, to be fair, it's only taught in Python and Java, so why am I doing it in C++? Because I wanna program in C++. (Oh, and one is in [C#](./02-your-ride-is-here/ride.cs).)

## Feedback ##

There's no need to tell me how I can do better on each of the problems. I can find solutions by myself (and I probably did), so if there's an inefficiency, it's because I'm ok with it.
